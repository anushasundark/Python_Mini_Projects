# Guess the Number (User)

## Introduction

Welcome to the "Guess the Number (User)" game! In this Python program, the computer tries to guess a number that you (the user) are thinking of.

## How to Play

1. Run the `guess_the_number.py` file using a Python interpreter.
2. Think of a number and enter it when prompted.
3. The computer will make random guesses within a specified range.
4. Provide feedback to the computer after each guess:
    - If the computer's guess is too low, inform it to try a higher number.
    - If the computer's guess is too high, inform it to try a lower number.
    - If the computer correctly guesses your number, the game congratulates you.
5. The program will display the number of attempts it took for the computer to guess correctly.
