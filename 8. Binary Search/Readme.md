# Binary Search for Strings

## Overview

This Python script demonstrates the implementation of the binary search algorithm on a sorted list of strings. The user is prompted to enter both the sorted list of strings and the target string to be searched.

## Usage

1. Ensure that you have Python installed on your system.

2. Open the `binary_search.py` file.

3. Run the script:

4. The script will prompt you to enter a sorted list of strings (comma-separated) and the target string you want to search for.

5. After providing the input, the script will output whether the target string was found and its index or if it was not found in the list.

## Example

For example:

- Enter the sorted list of strings: "apple, banana, cherry, date, grape, kiwi, orange"
- Enter the target string: "kiwi"

The output would be:

String 'kiwi' found at index 5
