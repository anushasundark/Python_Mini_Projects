# Tic-Tac-Toe AI

## Overview

Tic-Tac-Toe AI is a simple Python implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game, where you can play against an AI opponent that employs the Minimax algorithm to make strategic moves.

## Features

- Human vs AI gameplay.
- AI opponent never loses due to Minimax algorithm.
- Command-line interface for easy interaction.

## Game Rules
- The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
- Players take turns making moves; 'X' for the human player, and 'O' for the AI.
- The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.
- If the board is full and no player has won, the game ends in a tie.

  ## AI Strategy
- The AI uses the Minimax algorithm to determine the best possible move at any given state of the game. This ensures that the AI plays optimally and never loses.
